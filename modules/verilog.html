        Verilog HDL & FPGA Synthesis
      </h1>
      <p>
        Using Verilog HDL within the AMD Xilinx environment, I designed, tested and synthesized a multitude of digital logic circuits. The design process for these circuits featured the use of both behavioral description to take advantage of the Verilog language's complex built-in features, as well as structural design
	derived from numerical analysis involving behavioral diagrams, Karnaugh maps and boolean algebraic reduction methods. I designed both combinational and synchronous circuits, which were then tested using a self-written test bench within the Xilinx software then synthesized onto a physical FPGA device.

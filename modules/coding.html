        Programming in Python, C, Java
      </h1>
      <p>
        I have experience coding in Python, C and Java through my studies as an engineering student. In these languages, I have programmed various small-scale projects which have allowed me to gain a fundamental understanding of the general programming workflow across any language. I have self-taught the basics of
	HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to build this website.
